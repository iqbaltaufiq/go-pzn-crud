# go-pzn-crud
This is a repository created after finishing Programmer Zaman Now's Golang RESTful API course.

### Summary
A simple CRUD application built with [httprouter](https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter) and [testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify).
No web framework, mostly Go built-in features.

Just for educational purposes. May cause you headache.
